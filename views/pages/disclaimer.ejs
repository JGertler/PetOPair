Last updated:  Oct. 6th, 2017

1. Acceptance of Terms; Modifications.  These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) are a binding legal agreement between you and A Place for PetO'Pair, Inc. (“PetOPair.com,” “we,” “us” and “our”).   The Terms govern your use of our software applications, resources and services for pet owners and pet service providers to find each other, communicate with each other, and arrange for the provision of pet care services (collectively, our “PetOPair.com Service”).  The Terms govern all use of the PetOPair.com Service, whether you access it from our website at https://www.PetOPair.com(the “Site”), our mobile applications and mobile websites, our Facebook application, our online or phone support offerings, or any other access point we make available to you. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE PetOPair.COM SERVICE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, YOU SHOULD NOT ACCEPT THEM, IN WHICH CASE YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE THE PetOPair.COM SERVICE.

You understand and agree that we may change the Terms from time to time, and that any such changes will be effective immediately (except as otherwise described in Section 18.9 below) when we post the modified Terms on the PetOPair.com Service.  Your continued access and use of the PetOPair.com Service after we post the modified Terms will constitute your consent to be bound by the modified Terms.

2. PetOPair.com Service.

2.1  Nature of the PetOPair.com Service.  The PetOPair.com Service consists of a desktop Web application, mobile applications, and other related tools, support and services that pet owners (“Pet Owners”) and providers of pet-related services (“Service Providers”) can use to find, communicate with and interact with each other.   The PetOPair.com Service includes our emergency support services, educational materials for Service Providers, our PetOPairGO and PetOPair Match services, our PetOPair Protection Package, our Resolution Center, and other related services.   We charge fees for some aspects of the PetOPair.com Service, as described below in Section 10.

2.2  PetOPair.com does not provide Pet Care Services.  PetOPair.com is a neutral venue for Service Providers and Pet Owners.  PetOPair.com is not a Service Provider and, except for emergency phone support and other resources and support specifically described in the PetOPair.com Service, does not provide pet care services.   We make no representations or warranties about the quality of boarding, pet sitting, dog walking, house sitting, transportation, or other services provided by Service Providers (“Pet Care Services”), or about your interactions and dealings with users. Though we provide general guidance on our Site to Service Providers about safety and pet care and to Pet Owners about selecting and engaging Service Providers, PetOPair.com does not employ, recommend or endorse Service Providers or Pet Owners, and we will not be responsible or liable for the performance or conduct of Service Providers or Pet Owners, whether online or offline.  We conduct an initial review of Service Provider applications and we facilitate background checks on Service Providers conducted by a third party, but, except where explicitly specified in the PetOPair.com Service (and then only to the extent specified), do not otherwise screen Service Providers or Pet Owners.   You should exercise caution and use your independent judgment before engaging a Service Provider, providing services, or otherwise interacting with users via the PetOPair.com Service.  Pet Owners and Service Providers are solely responsible for making decisions that are in the best interests of themselves and their pets.  For example, each user of the PetOPair.com Service is responsible for keeping current his or her own pet’s vaccinations, and we will have no liability for anyone’s failure to vaccinate his or her pet.

2.3  Release.  We hereby expressly disclaim, and you hereby expressly release us from, any and all liability whatsoever for any contPetOPairsies, claims, suits, injuries, loss, harm and/or damages arising from and/or in any way related to your interactions or dealings with other users and the acts and/or omissions of Service Providers and Pet Owners, whether online or offline.  You acknowledge and agree that YOUR USE AND/OR PROVISION OF PET CARE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RISK.

2.4  Transactions are between Pet Owners and Service Providers.  The PetOPair.com Service may be used to find and offer Pet Care Services and to facilitate payment, but all transactions conducted via the PetOPair.com Service are between Pet Owners and Service Providers.   Except for the limited refunds of PetOPair.com’s fees described in Section 10.5 and the “Reservation Guarantee” specified in Section 10.5, you agree that PetOPair.com has no liability for damages associated with Pet Care Services (which may include bodily injury to, or death of, a pet) or resulting from any other transactions between users of the PetOPair.com Service.

2.5  Bookings.  Pet Owners and Service Providers transact with each other on the PetOPair.com Service when they both agree to a “booking” that specifies the fees, time period, cancellation policy, and other terms for provision of Pet Care Services (a “Booking”).  One you complete a Booking, you agree to honor the price and other terms of that Booking.  For more information about Bookings, please visit https://support.PetOPair.com/hc/en-us/articles/205980546-How-do-I-book-with-a-sitter-or-dog-walker-.

2.6  Pet Owners are Solely Responsible for Evaluating Service Providers.  Pet Owners are solely responsible for evaluating the suitability of Service Providers for the services they offer to provide.  Please visit https://support.PetOPair.com/hc/en-us/articles/203062300-How-do-I-choose-the-right-sitter- for guidance about making informed decisions about engaging Service Providers.  Though PetOPair.com performs a limited review of applications to become Service Providers and facilitates Service Provider  background checks conducted by a third party, any such screening is limited, and PetOPair.com does not warrant that any such screen is accurate, complete, conclusive or up-to-date.  Similarly, PetOPair.com does not endorse reviews of Service Providers by other Pet Owners that may be available via the PetOPair.com Service, and PetOPair.com makes no commitments that such reviews are accurate or legitimate.

2.7  Abandoned Pets; Re-homing.  Pet Owners who arrange for Pet Care Services and fail to retrieve their pet within seven (7) days after the service period identified in a Booking (or an earlier period required under applicable animal abandonment or cruelty laws) agree that PetOPair.com (or the Service Provider) may, in its (or his or her) sole discretion, place the pet in foster care and/or notify animal control authorities. Pet Owner agrees to reimburse PetOPair.com and/or the Service Provider for all costs and expenses associated with such actions.  Further, PetOPair.com expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to remove a Pet Owner’s pet from a Service Provider’s care should PetOPair.com deem it necessary for the safety of a pet, the Service Provider, or any persons living with the Service Provider. Prior to removing a pet from the care of a Service Provider, PetOPair.com will use reasonable efforts during PetOPair.com’s normal business hours to contact the Pet Owner and/or the Pet Owner’s emergency contact (if provided) to arrange alternative care. Should PetOPair.com not be able to contact the Pet Owner or the emergency contact, PetOPair.com will use its best judgment to find alternative care for the pet until the Pet Owner is able to retrieve his/her pet.  If you are a Pet Owner, you authorize your pet’s veterinarian(s) to release your pet’s veterinary records to PetOPair.com in connection with any such relocation or re-homing of your pet. In addition, you are responsible for and agree to pay all costs and expenses incurred by PetOPair.com in connection with such transfer, including any additional charges for new Bookings.

2.8  Emergencies.  We recommend that Pet Owners give their Service Providers contact information where they can be reached in the event medical care for a pet becomes necessary. Service Providers agree to immediately contact Pet Owners in the event such care becomes necessary or, if contact information for the Pet Owner is not available, to contact PetO'Pair.com by phone at 1-888-727-1140 or at trust@PetOPair.com.  If you are a Pet Owner, you hereby authorize your Service Provider and PetOPair.com to obtain and authorize the provision of veterinary care for your pet if you cannot be reached to authorize care yourself in an emergency situation. In such case, you also authorize your pet’s veterinarian(s) to release your pet’s veterinary records to PetOPair.com.  Pet Owners are solely responsible for the costs of any such medical treatment for pets and, if you are a Pet Owner, you hereby authorize PetOPair.com to charge your credit card or other payment method for such costs. In certain circumstances, Pet Owner may be eligible for reimbursement through insurance coverage, as more fully described in Section 8.

2.9  Consultation Services.  PetOPair.com may offer Pet Owners and Service Providers phone, chat, or email veterinary consultation services from a third party to provide an educational resource for decisions you make about your own pets or pets in your care.  These consultation services are provided by a third party, and are not a part of the PetOPair.com Service.  If you use these third party consultation services, you should use them only in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for, professional veterinary care.  You agree to resort solely to the applicable third party consultation service in the event of any claims arising from their services.

It is your sole responsibility to maintain backup copies of Your Content.

8.5  Legal Compliance.  Service Providers are solely responsible for carrying insurance sufficient to comply with legal requirements in the jurisdictions where Service Providers provide services.  PetOPair.com makes no commitment that the Insurance Program will suffice for that purpose. PetOPair.com does not verify whether Service Providers have obtained insurance, and Pet Owners are advised to inquire directly with Service Providers about this subject.

8.6  Termination in the Event of Suit.  You acknowledge and agree that all rights and benefits granted to you under the Insurance Program shall immediately terminate in the event you initiate any action, suit or claim against PetOPair.com, or its officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, or affiliates, concerning a claim otherwise subject to coverage under the Insurance Program.

9. Location Information; Consent to Communications.The PetOPair.com Service’s mobile applications may implement location features that, if you consent, result in automatic collection of your geolocation information, in which case our mobile application may use such information to allow users to determine which other users are nearby. We may also use this location information to provide information and advertising. IF YOU WANT TO STOP THE AUTOMATIC COLLECTION OF YOUR LOCATION INFORMATION, YOU MAY DO SO BY USING THE PRIVACY SETTINGS IN OUR MOBILE APPLICATION AND/OR ON YOUR DEVICE, OR BY UNINSTALLING OUR MOBILE APPLICATION.Certain aspects of the Service may not function without the collection of geolocation information.

You consent to PetOPair.com communicating with you about the PetOPair.com Service by SMS, text message, email and other electronic means. Your carrier's normal, messaging, data and other rates and fees will apply to these communications.  In the event you deactivate a mobile phone number provided to us for this purpose, you agree to update your PetOPair account information promptly to ensure that messages are not sent to the person who acquires your old number.

10. Fees & Payment.

10.1 Currency.  All fees, deductible amounts and other payments referenced on, or charged through, the PetOPair.com Service are listed and payable in local currency.  (If you use the PetOPair.com Service to book a Service Provider in the United States, your payments will be in USD; if you use the PetOPair.com Service to book a Service Provider in Canada, your payments will be in CAD.)

10.2  Fees for Pet Owners.  Pet Owners may purchase Pet Care Services from a Service Provider by completing a Booking as described in Section 2.5.  If you are a Pet Owner, you enter into a transaction with the Service Provider when you accept a Booking, and you agree to pay the total fees indicated in the Booking.  Except where otherwise specifically indicated on the PetOPair.com Service, fees for Pet Care Services are determined by Service Providers.  As described in Section 10.3, the total amount Pet Owners are charged for a Booking may also include a service fee payable to PetOPair.com.  Where required by law, the amount charged may also be inclusive of applicable taxes.  The Service Provider, not PetOPair.com, is responsible for performing the Pet Care Services.

10.3  Fees for Service Providers.  Service Providers may agree to provide Pet Care Services to a Pet Owner by agreeing to a Booking as described in Section 2.5.  If you are a Service Provider, you must confirm the Booking before it expires or the Pet Care Owner will have no obligation to complete the transaction.  Once the Booking is completed by both parties, you agree to honor the price set forth in your Booking.  The purchase of Pet Care Services is a transaction between the Pet Owner and the Service Provider.  PetOPair.com’s role is to facilitate payments from Pet Owners to Service Providers as an agent for the Service Provider.  We collect payment from the Pet Owner at the time of Booking and (except to the extent of any payment hold pursuant to Section 10.7) remit payment to the Service Provider’s account on the PetOPair.com Service 48 hours after completion of the service period indicated in the Booking.   Service Providers are charged a service fee as described in Section 10.3, which we deduct before remitting payment to Service Providers.

10.4  Service Fees.  We charge service fees for some aspects of the PetOPair.com Service.   If you are a Service Provider, except where otherwise specified via the PetOPair.com Service, our service fee is calculated as a percentage of the fees a Pet Owner agrees to pay in a Booking.  We deduct this service fee from the amounts paid by the Pet Owner.  Our service fees are described here.

10.5  Late Fees and Additional Charges.  If you are a Pet Owner, you acknowledge and agree that, if you fail to retrieve your pet at the end of the service period agreed in a Booking, you will be charged a late pickup fee for each partial late day at the daily rate established in the Booking.  In addition, you agree to indemnify PetOPair.com from, and agree that we may charge your credit card or other payment method for, any additional costs and expenses we or the Service Provider incur as a result of your failure to retrieve your pet at the end of the service period agreed in a Booking.

10.6  Cancellations and Refunds.

     Cancellations by Service Provider.  If a Service Provider cancels a Booking prior to or during the service period identified in the Booking, we will refund the fees paid by the Pet Owner for Pet Care Services not provided, as well as any service charge paid to PetOPair.com.  Service Provider cancellations are taken seriously.  If you are a Service Provider, you acknowledge that cancellation by you may result in a review of your account and, if we deem it appropriate, suspension or termination of your access to the PetOPair.com Service.
     Reservation Guarantee.  As more fully described on PetOPair.com’s Reservation Guarantee page, PetOPair.com uses all reasonable efforts to find replacement Service Providers when Service Providers cancel Bookings near the start date of the service period identified in the Booking.  The availability of the Reservation Guarantee depends on the timing of the cancellation and the type of Pet Care Services provided; consult the Reservation Guarantee page for details. Generally, if the Reservation Guarantee applies and a Pet Owner accepts a new Booking with a replacement Service Provider, PetOPair.com will (with the limited exceptions described below) pay the cost difference between the original Booking and the new Booking, up to but not exceeding 25% of the total cost of the original Booking.  However, if a Booking is cancelled by a Service Provider due to the Pet Owner’s failure to provide accurate or complete information regarding the pet or due to the pet’s aggressive behavior, the Pet Owner is responsible for the full cost of any new reservation.
     Cancellations by Pet Owner.   If a Pet Owner cancels a Booking prior to or during the service period specified in a Booking, we will refund fees in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Service Provider on the PetOPair.com Service.  All Service Providers are required to select a cancellation policy prior to completing a Booking so that Pet Owners are aware of the cancellation policy prior to Booking.  For more information about cancellation policies, please visit https://support.PetOPair.com/hc/en-us/articles/201173720-What-are-the-sitter-cancellation-policies-
     Refunds for Substandard Services.  If we determine in our reasonable discretion that a Service Provider has failed to provide Pet Care Services in accordance with our guidelines and policies on the Site or these terms then we may, in our reasonable discretion, cancel a Booking and issue a full or partial refund to a Pet Owner.
     General Terms for Cancellations.  If you wish to cancel a Booking, you should use the mechanisms available through the PetOPair.com Service to do so. For purposes of the policies and terms in this Section 10.6, the date of cancelation is the date a user cancels through the PetOPair.com Service, regardless of any separate communications between users outside of the PetOPair.com Service.
     Payment Disputes; Payment Outside of the PetOPair.com Service.  PetOPair.com issues payments to Service Providers 48 hours after completion of a Booking.  Once these amounts have been disbursed, any further payment disputes are between the Pet Owner and Service Provider, and PetOPair.com has no obligation to mediate or facilitate any resolution.  Further, PetOPair.com has no responsibility or liability with respect to any tips, bonuses, or other payments made outside of the PetOPair.com Service.
10.7  Payment Holds.  If you are a Service Provider, we may issue a hold on amounts otherwise payable to you pursuant to Section 10.3 under the circumstances described in our Payment Hold Policy.  We may also recommend that third party payment service providers restrict your access to funds in your account under the same circumstances.

10.8   Resolution Center.  As part of resolving a claim through the Resolution Center, Service Providers and Pet Owners may offer or request refunds, damage payments or other accommodations related to their Bookings.  In such cases, both parties agree that they are responsible for performing their agreements, and that PetOPair is not party to any such agreement and has no obligation to perform any term thereof (except to facilitate payments in accordance with this Section 10).  When you participate in a Resolution Center case, you agree to pay all amounts sent through the Resolution Center via your account on the PetOPair.com Service.

10.9  Authorization to Charge.   When you pay for Pet Care Services or for other services on the PetOPair.com Service, you will be required to provide us with valid, up-to-date credit card or other payment information. You authorize us to charge your credit card or other payment method for fees you incur on the PetOPair.com Service as they become due and payable. You are responsible for maintaining up-to-date payment information. If we cannot charge you for fees when due because your payment information is no longer valid, or if we do not receive your payment when due, then you understand that neither PetOPair.com nor the Service Provider will be responsible for any failure to provide services associated with those fees.  Except as expressly provided in these Terms, all fees paid via the PetOPair.com Service are non-refundable once paid.

10.10   Taxes.  Except for taxes on PetOPair.com’s income and gross receipts generally, you acknowledge that you are responsible to pay any taxes that arise as a result of your purchase, provision, or use of services via the PetOPair.com Service.  This includes, without limitation, any form of sales tax or income tax on fees paid or received through the PetOPair.com Service.

11. Background Checks.

PetOPair.com may provide Service Providers with access to third party consumer reporting agencies that perform, among other things, criminal records checks, sex offender registry checks, motor vehicle records checks and identification verifications (collectively, “Background Checks”).   We do not provide, and are not responsible or liable in any manner for, the Background Checks, and we do not endorse or make any representations or warranties regarding the reliability of such Background Checks or the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of any information in the Background Checks. We do not independently verify information in the Background Checks.

If you undergo a Background Check via the PetOPair.com Service, you hereby consent to the collection, use and disclosure of the information in the Background Checks, and you agree to provide complete and accurate information for your Background Check. You understand and agree that PetOPair.com may, in its sole discretion, review and rely on the information in the Background Checks in deciding whether to suspend or terminate or investigate a complaint about a Service Provider, but also that we are not obligated to do so, and are not responsible or liable in any way in the event that any information in any Background Check is not accurate, timely or complete. If you are the subject of a Background Check, you may contact the applicable third-party consumer reporting agency to dispute the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of such information. You agree that PetOPair’s rights and obligations under the Arbitration Agreement inure to the benefit of the consumer reporting agency used for Background Checks in respect of any claim that would be subject to the Arbitration Agreement if brought against us.  PetOPair.com reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the PetOPair.com Service based on information in the Background Checks or for any other reason, or no reason, in our sole discretion.

Pet Owners remain fully liable to evaluate and investigate Service Providers.  Be aware of the following limitations in Background Checks: Except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms or through the Service, PetOPair.com does not automatically run Background Checks on any Users. Records not available to third-party Background Checking agencies will not be included in the results. Not all arrest logs and records, conviction and correction records, sex offender registries and motor vehicle records are available in all jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions there is a delay before arrest logs and records, conviction and correction records, sex offender registries and motor vehicle records are included in Background Checks. Juvenile records and offenses for minors may not appear in the public record and are therefore not included in the results. Dismissed cases, arrests not resulting in convictions, arrests or convictions from foreign countries and nolle pros will not be reported. Traffic violations are not included unless a jurisdiction reports them as criminal offenses. In the jurisdictions where traffic violations are reported as criminal offenses, such traffic violations may be included in the results as misdemeanors or felonies.

18. Arbitration Agreement.

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH PetOPair.COM AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.

18.1   Arbitration Agreement; Claims.   This Section 18 is referred to as the "Arbitration Agreement” in these Terms.  Unless you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement in accordance with the procedure described in Section 18.9 below, you and PetOPair.com (together, the “Parties”) agree that any and all disputes or claims that arise between you and PetOPair.com relating to the PetOPair.com Service, interactions with others on the PetOPair.com Service, and/or these Terms (including any alleged breach of these Terms) (collectively, “Claims”), except for Excluded Claims (defined in the following sentence), will be resolved  as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement. As used herein, “Excluded Claims” means (1) individual claims brought in small claims court (if your claims qualify), (2) claims arising out of or related to a violation of Section 4.1, above, (3) claims in which either party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property (including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents), and (4) claims that, as a matter of applicable law, cannot be made subject to arbitration.

18.2   Agreement to Arbitrate.  Unless you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement in accordance with the procedure described in Section 18.9 below, you agree that any and all Claims (other than Excluded Claims) will be resolved exclusively on an individual basis through final and binding arbitration, rather than in a court, in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement, and your rights in connection with all Claims (other than Excluded Claims) will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not by a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.  To the extent that the Parties' dispute involves both timely filed Excluded Claims and other Claims subject to this Agreement, the Parties agree to bifurcate and stay for the duration of the arbitration proceedings any such Excluded Claims.

18.3 Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.  YOU AND PetOPair.COM AGREE THAT, UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 18.9 BELOW, EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS (EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM IN A PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION CANNOT BE WAIVED AS A MATTER OF LAW) AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND PetOPair.COM AGREE OTHERWISE (OR TO THE EXTENT THAT THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM IN A PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION CANNOT BE WAIVED AS A MATTER OF LAW), THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER PetOPair.COM USERS.

18.4  Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution.  Before you commence arbitration, we suggest that you contact us to explain your complaint. Our preference will always be to resolve complaints amicably and efficiently, without the need for arbitration. You may contact us via email at legal@PetOPair.com or by mail at A Place for PetOPair, Inc., Attn:  Legal, 2101 4th Ave., Suite 400, Seattle, WA 98121.  If the issue is not resolved and results in arbitration, we will need to mutually select and agree upon an arbitrator and the rules and procedures to govern the arbitration.

18.5  Arbitration Procedures.   The Parties will try in good faith to mutually select and agree upon an arbitrator and rules and procedures to govern the arbitration.  If we cannot agree, then the arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The rules that apply are those in effect when arbitration is demanded by either of the Parties.  For information on JAMS, please visit its website, https://www.jamsadr.com/.  The JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures are available at www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration, which are incorporated by reference.  You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.  If there is any inconsistency between the JAMS Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would, including without limitation, the limitation of liability provisions in Section 17. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms and applicable law. The arbitrator shall submit a decision in writing, specifying the findings of fact and the conclusions of law on which the decision is based.  Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.

The arbitration will be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or PetOPair.com may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election will be binding on you and PetOPair.com subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at any in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or PetOPair.com, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.

The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator will not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different PetOPair.com users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same PetOPair.com user to the extent required by applicable law.  As limited by the Federal Arbitration Act, these Terms and the applicable JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have (1) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Claim, including the determination of whether a Claim is arbitrable, and (2) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.

18.6  Costs of Arbitration.  Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the "Arbitration Fees") will be shared equally by you and PetOPair, except where prohibited by applicable law.  In addition, (1) if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, PetOPair.com will pay your portion of such fees, and (2) if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, PetOPair.com will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Each party will be solely responsible for all other fees it incurs in connection with the arbitration, including without limitation, all attorney fees. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse PetOPair.com for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by PetOPair.com on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the JAMS Rules.

18.7  Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.

18.8  Severability.  If any term, clause or provision of this Section 18 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section 18 will remain valid and enforceable.

18.9  Opt-Out Procedure.  You can choose to reject this Arbitration Agreement by mailing us a written opt-out notice ("Opt-Out Notice") in accordance with the terms of this Section 18.9. For new PetOPair.com users, the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the date you accept these Terms for the first time. If you are already a current PetOPair.com user and previously accepted the PetOPair.com Terms, the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than July 16, 2017. You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to A Place for PetOPair, Inc., Attn: Legal, 2101 4th Ave., Suite 400, Seattle, WA 98121. The Opt-Out Notice must state that you do not agree to the Arbitration Agreement and must include your name, address, phone number, and the email address(es) used to register for the PetOPair.com Service to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, the entire Arbitration Agreement will not apply with respect to you, but the remainder of these Terms will continue to apply. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.  By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Claims (including Excluded Claims) in accordance with Section 19.

18.10  Future Changes to this Arbitration Agreement.  Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you agree that if we make any change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that change will not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against PetOPair.com prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we terminate this Arbitration Agreement by removing it from these Terms, such termination will not be effective until 30 days after the version of these Terms not containing the Arbitration Agreement is posted to the Site, and will not be effective as to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against PetOPair.com prior to the effective date of removal.

19. Governing Law and Jurisdiction.  These Terms, and any dispute between you and PetOPair.com, will be governed by the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, except that the Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of Section 18 (the Arbitration Agreement). Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the Arbitration Agreement is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, you agree that any claim or dispute that arises between you and PetOPair.com must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in the State of Washington. You and PetOPair.com agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Seattle, Washington for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.

20. Miscellaneous.  Nothing in this Agreement will be construed as making either party the partner, joint venturer, agent, legal representative, employer, contractor or employee of the other. Neither party will have, or hold itself out to any third party as having, any authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action, that will be binding on the other, except as provided for herein or authorized in writing by the party to be bound. The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any term or provision of these Terms will in no way effect the validity, legality or enforceability of any other term or provision of these Terms. In the event a term or provision is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and these Terms will be enforceable as so modified.  This Agreement will be binding on and will inure to the benefit of the legal representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto.

If you have any questions about anything in these Terms, please contact us via email at legal@PetOPair.com or by mail at A Place for PetOPair, Inc., Attn:  Legal, 2101 4th Ave., Suite 400, Seattle, WA 98121.
